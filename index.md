Y-Foundry
=========

Introducing Y-Foundry!

Y-Foundry is a platform connecting community with creators to propose, vote, and build their ideas.

**Developed by the community.**

**Owned by the community.**

Bringing an idea to market requires massive amounts of effort to coordinate developers, creators, and investment capital. Y-Foundry provides creators with the means to connect with the community and launch their projects. Anyone with a great idea can propose it to the Y-Foundry DAO, receive support to expand on their ideas, and find additional resources within the community. Y-Foundry enables creators and developers to connect, ideate, fund, and build the community-owned crypto projects of tomorrow.

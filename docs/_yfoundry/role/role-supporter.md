# About The Supporter

![Supporter Bot](/assets/images/role/supporter-bot.png)

***

## Requirement
The Supporter role is reserved for DAO members who contribute to a proposal on YFD.

DAO members earn a Supporter role by depositing resources into proposals. The resources contributed are utilized by the Builder defined in the proposal to achieve the proposal's objectives.

## Responsibilities
### Funding Proposal Requirements
Supporters are responsible for providing the resources necessary to help a proposal launch. This most typically consists of some form of funding but could also include any other necessary support specified in the proposal.

{: .note}
> The funding floor for a Supporter is 5% of the total funding required. Supporters are able to fund more depending on their conviction behind a vault idea and ability to support. See [Proposal Process](../../vault/2-proposal/) for more details.

### Governing Projects
Supporters are more than just financial backers of projects. For the projects they are supporting, Supporters also guide the direction of the project, disbursement of funds, and completion of the final product through proposal-specific governance votes.

## Benefits
The Supporter receives interactive YFD NFTs representing a share of the success of the vault they have supported. See [NFT Generation](../../vault/5-vault-nft/) and [Profit Sharing Disbursement](../../vault/6-profit-sharing/) for more details.

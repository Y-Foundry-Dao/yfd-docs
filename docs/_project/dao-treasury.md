DAO Treasury
============

The majority of the DAO's tokens are held in a multi-signature wallet post-TGE.
This is a smart contract that require the agreement of five of the nine (signers) to perform an action. 

Multiple private keys held by members of the community are required to execute any transaction using the contract.

The Treasury Multi-sig is useful for protecting assets (through separation of duties) and helps ensure that certain actions are only taken in accordance with will of the signers.

For more information on this, please read [Proposals]().

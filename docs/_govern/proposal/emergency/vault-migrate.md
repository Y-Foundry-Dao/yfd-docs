# 🔁Vault Migration

{: .warning } 
> EMERGENCY GOVERNANCE ACTION

## Stop
The action response initiated by The Forge contract when an Emergency Vault Proposal has passed affirmatively.
	
{: .important}
> FOR MVP: Emergency Vault Stop is performed purely in The Forge.
>
Upon a successful vote the Forge will migrate the Vault Contract with a template that prevents any action against the vault contract or the funds.
Another contract can be deployed at a later time to reactive the vault.

***

## Restart

A governance proposal that, if passed, initiates the upgrade of an existing vault contract with new code.

New vault code should be uploaded/deployed using the Vault Deploy proposal (or a vault maintenance proposal)

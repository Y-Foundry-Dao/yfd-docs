Contract Deployment
===================

Once the code for a New Vault Proposal Submission has passed the final review by the community, it is ready to be deployed onto the chain. A proposal is submitted to the fYFD holders saying "Proposal ##" is completed.

Vault Contract Deployment Proposals are initiated by a Vault Proposal *Strategist* + *Boosters* Vote

The Strategist should be someone from the vault proposal leadership of the vault being deployed.

Once Qualifiers for Contract Deployment Development of the vault is completed and has been approved by the Strategist + Booster Proposal, funds have been spent and the proposal should hold $0 in assets.

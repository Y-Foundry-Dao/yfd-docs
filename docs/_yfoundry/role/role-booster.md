# About The Booster

![Booster](/assets/images/learn/role/booster.png)

***

## Requirement
The Boosters are the fervent supporters of project vaults on Y-Foundry. Boosting means providing specific support to enable the creation of a vault, usually in the way of funding for the project. Boosters get this role by boosting any Y-Foundry vault.

## Responsibilities
### Supporting Vaults
Boosters are responsible for providing the resources necessary to develop a vault. This most typically consists of some form of funding but could also include any other necessary support specified in the vault proposal.

{: .note}
> The funding floor for a Booster is 5% of the total funding required. Boosters are able to fund more depending on their conviction behind a vault idea and ability to support. See [Proposal Process](../../vault/2-proposal/) for more details.

### Governing Projects
Boosters are more than just financial backers of projects. For the projects they are boosting, Boosters also guide the direction of the project, disbursement of funds, and completion of the final product through vault-specific governance votes.

## Benefits
The Booster receives Booster NFTs representing a share of the success of the vault they have boosted. See [NFT Generation](../../vault/5-vault-nft/) and [Profit Sharing Disbursement](../../vault/6-profit-sharing/) for more details.

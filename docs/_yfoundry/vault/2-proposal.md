# ✍️ Proposal Process

A proposer submits the proposal officially through the Y-Foundry platform. This will turn all the previously documented proposal information from the idea stage into a series of on-chain instructions for launching the project vault.

Once the proposal is submitted on the Y-Foundry platform, the Y-Foundry DAO community votes to approve the vault. If approved by the community, the vault will then be available for boosting.

Supporters can become Boosters of a project by depositing funds in the project vault now available on Y-Foundry. These funds are to be used exclusively for the development of the project.

{: .note}
> Booster funds can only be disbursed to the pre-whitelisted builder(s) specified in the proposal. 
> 
> Vault proposals will be held in escrow contigent upon the fulfillment of development milestones.

Once the vault launches, each Booster receives NFT shares representing their percentage of ownership of the vault.

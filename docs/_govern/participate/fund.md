# ðŸ’¸ Proposal Funding


WIP
{: .label .label-blue}

### How to Fund a Proposal
Users who lock $YFD in the Forge Contract become a member of the Boule.
#### Benefits & Responsibilities of the Boule

- Voting
    - Treasury Spend
    - Crucible Member Elections

- Fund Proposals
    - Profit Sharing

## ðŸš€ Voting + Boosting (Funding)
For proposals that are not 100% funded by the Strategist at the time of Boule vote.

Boule members when depositing vote tokens into a proposal can contribute stablecoins alongside their vote tokens to become a Booster
Voter Stablecoin Deposit Restrictions:
Voter contributed stablecoins are accepted until the development funding total cost defined in the proposal is reached.
Contribution of stablecoin funds by an individual is limited by the individual fYFD funding limit based on the fYFD amount of the individual
1 fYFD = 1 $YFD worth of stablecoins, based on $YFD price recorded at time of proposal submission
Minimum Booster Deposit (fixed value assigned to NFTs (equilibrium)):
The minimum stablecoin deposit required is: 
The amount to completely receive the profit of one NFT
To be deposited in complete NFT segments
Maximum deposit allowed per Booster:
10% of total booster funding allotted 
Vault Proposal Funding Maximum Limit Check
When a booster votes and attempts to fund a vault proposal the proposal contract checks to see if the limit for funding (maximum) has been reached
Proposal rejects contract execution based on funding limit being reached
User can resubmit vote without funding
When funding is reached the proposal voting continues until voting block time has expired. (no early execution)

Total contribution of individual boule members is limited by the development funding total cost minus any amount already contributed by the Strategist. (Strategist gets first pick in funding the proposal)


### Notes

    1M is the starter Maximum funding... DAO governance can change it.   Minimum (self-funded) funding limit is $1 
    Funding is done is stable coins (DAO votes to whitelist tokens to be used for funding) 

    Funding is deposited into the proposal by the proposer + community members (Boosters)
    Developer is not required to deposit anything, but the developer must be whitelisted by the community (DAO) in a global vote to approve them for development projects on YFD
    Developer does not have to stake YFD
    Boosters (community members who want to fund development) and the Strategist Proposer must stake $YFD to get fYFD points equivalent to thei amount they want to fund the proposal. 

    Payout is on a schedule set and determined by the strategist and locked in place at the time the initial proposal is approved
    at every milestone (set at proposal submission) the Boosters (community members who funded the proposal) + the Strategist must vote to release the funds to the developer
    this way it assures maximum capital efficiency in that funds are disbursed unless work is actually being done and if money is decided to be released it's decided by the individuals who funded the vault development
    this is 100% all on chain -- you don't need a website to go through the process - you can interact with the contracts directly

# About Y-Foundry

## YFD is about getting ideas off the ground.

Imagine a crowdfunding platform and marketplace owned by a community of builders and utilizing cutting-edge blockchain technology to enable secure operations, transparent governance, and automated payment for work performed. Y-Foundry DAO is this community-driven accelerator of ideas providing a powerful way for creators to connect with builders and funding in a transparent and decentralized way.

## Decentralized, but not in name only.

Y-Foundry is a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Built on blockchain technology and smart contracts, YFD provides an open-source platform for members to vote on decisions related to the projects, platform, and overall marketplace that make up the YFD ecosystem.

## Draw on your community for support and guidance.

Creators are able to receive input from the community and refine their ideas before proposing a project. When a project idea is ready, creators can submit it to the community for consideration. Members of the community can support the project by becoming a booster to provide the project with the necessary funds to launch and then share in its success. Whitelisted builders from within the community can accept bounties to help build the project: community investment, development, and ownership.

## The unique value of Y-Foundry DAO.

_The ability for the protocol to self-fund development without dilution of its token/governance power._

_The decoupling of Governance and the Treasury, such that the Treasury is a smart contract accountable to perform actions as determined by on-chain governance._

_This is in contrast to the current models of governance in DeFi where governance proposals are generally “text-only”, and the executor of the governance action is usually a human or group of human beings using a multisig or shared private key._

_The ability to provide guaranteed funding to developers through the escrow of funds to a smart contract with the capability for clawbacks should the stakeholders determine that deliverables have not been met._

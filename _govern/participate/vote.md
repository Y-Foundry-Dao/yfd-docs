> Reaching Quorum
>
> Because $YFD unlocks due to fYFD points decaying each block, inactive users slowly lose goverance power.  This means that active users that reclaim and relock $YFD stand to gain an increased proportion of governance power over time which should, in theory, reduce the threshold to reach quorum.

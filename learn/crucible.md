## Crucibles Defined

Crucibles are the working groups of YFD. Crucibles are a small team of business professionals and specialists each with a particular focus and all dedicated to the long-term growth and health of the DAO. They are the foundational pillars of the YFD protocol. 

Where an individual, or even the community, could be incentivized at times to act in short-term self-interest, the Crucibles have a natural incentive to act in the long-term collective interest of the protocol. 

Not only do they provide thought leadership for their respective areas of focus, they will also have the ability to help decide the direction of the protocol through influencing new vault/project proposals and critical governance items.

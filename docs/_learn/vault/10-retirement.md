# ðŸ”’ Decommissioning / Retirement
_(end of life)_

MVP
{: .label .label-blue }

To retire or decommission a vault the use of an emergency proposal called "Vault Stop" is necessary.  Vault Stop disallows the vault contract from accepting new funds.

{: .note }
Secondary function of "Vault Stop" may include withdrawing all assets from the underlying strategy protocols to the safety of the vault contract itself.  This is a safety mechanism to allowing users to claim their deposited assets regardless of the state of external protocols.

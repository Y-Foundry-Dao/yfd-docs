WIP
{: .label .label-blue }

## Documentation File Location

> Store Documentation html and md files to be used in the jekkyl markdown site in the `docs` path

## Image and Binary File Location

> Images and Binary files are stored in the `asset` path
>
> Images specicially are stored in the `asset/images` path


## Image & File Naming Conventions

{: .important }
> **NO SPACES IN FILENAMES**

> Keep file names short and relevant.
>
> Use hyphens in documents to diliniate words.  Avoid using underscores or periods in filenames.  
>
> Avoid use of uppercase characters.
>
> Use lower case characters, even if the file name is a proper noun or name.


## Special Characters

> Do not use non-alphanumeric characters.

Replace characters such as: * : \ / < > | " ? [ ] ; = + & £ $ , with hyphens or an equivalent word

{: .note-title }
> Example
> 
> replace `&` with `and`

> Avoid using unconventional abbreviations or acronyms.
>
> Always include the file extension at the end of documents and image filenames.
>
> Three letter extensions are preferred over 4 letter where possible.

## File Extensions

{: .note-title }
> Example
> 
> replace `tiff` with `tif`
> and
> `jpeg` with `jpg`

## Date format

> Write dates in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD

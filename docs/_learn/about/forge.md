# 🔥The Forge (Governance)


Users can deposit $YFD in the Forge to acquire fYFD points.

![Time Weighted Goverance](/assets/images/learn/about/forge-fyfd-time_weighted_gov.jpg)

### Users with fYFD points can create:



* 💳Spend proposals to send funds from the treasury to a pre-whitelisted recipient address (service provider, community contributor, consultant, etc.).
* 🗒Text proposals (a proposal with no enforceable on-chain action).
* 🏛Parameter proposals to create, modify, or deprecate a governance parameter.
* 🚨Emergency proposals to stop/veto an existing vault, governance, or spend proposal etc.
* 🪙Vault proposals to create a new vault, essentially a community-funded work order that can be fulfilled by a developer to receive escrowed funds.
* 🏁Vault deployment proposal to deploy the code for a completed vault (making the forge the owner of that contract).
* ☑️Whitelist proposals to whitelist developers and their wallet addresses to be able to work on vault proposals and receive payment.

*On the creation of each proposal, vote tokens are issued to be claimed by wallet addresses with fYFD points. These voters are known collectively as the Boule.*

# ðŸ”¥Forge (Governance)


Users can lock $YFD to receive fYFD points.
Users with fYFD points can create:


* Spend proposals to send funds from the treasury to a pre-whitelisted recipient address (service provider, community contributor, consultant, etc.).
* Text proposals (a proposal with no enforceable on-chain action).
Parameter proposals to create, modify, or deprecate a governance parameter.
Emergency proposals to stop/veto an existing vault, governance, or spend proposal etc.
Vault proposals to create a new vault, essentially a community-funded work order that can be fulfilled by a developer to receive escrowed funds.
Vault deployment proposal to deploy the code for a completed vault (making the forge the owner of that contract).
Whitelist proposals to whitelist developers and their wallet addresses to be able to work on vault proposals and receive payment.


On the creation of each proposal, vote tokens are issued to be claimed by wallet addresses with fYFD points. These voters are known collectively as the Boule.

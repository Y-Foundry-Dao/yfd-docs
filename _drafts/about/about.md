# About Y-Foundry

## YFD is about getting ideas off the ground.

Imagine a crowdfunding platform and marketplace owned by a community of builders and utilizing cutting-edge blockchain technology to enable secure operations, transparent governance, and automated payment for work performed. Y-Foundry DAO is this community-driven accelerator of ideas providing a powerful way for creators to connect with builders and funding in a transparent and decentralized way.

## Decentralized, and not in name only.

Y-Foundry is a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Built on blockchain technology and smart contracts, YFD provides an open-source platform for members to vote on decisions related to the projects, platform, and overall marketplace that make up the YFD ecosystem.

## Draw on your community for support and guidance.

Creators can work with their community to refine their project ideas before submitting a proposal on the YFD platform. The community can then review the proposal, provide the necessary funding to help the project launch, and become a Supporter sharing the project's success. Whitelisted builders from within the YFD community can accept bounties to help build the project.

## The unique value of Y-Foundry DAO.

_Customisable on-chain fund-raising and governance mechanisms that enables transparency and accountability throughout the project development lifecycle. See [How Y-Foundry DAO Governance Works](../../govern/participate/)_

_Trustless execution of treasury actions based on on-onchain votes - no one has privileged access, not even the core team._

_A community of Proposers, Builders, Voters and Supporters whose credibility can be verified via on-chain profiles and past actions. See [Roles](../../role/overview/)_

DAO Groups
=======================

***

## Trade-Offs - Centralization vs Decentralization

The structure and tools of Y-Foundry DAO provide the ability for the community to decentralize decision-making and general operations. This enables participation from a large and diverse group without the need for a central authority. This diversity unlocks a range of benefits, such as increased inclusivity and innovation, but it also introduces trade-offs when compared to a more centralized approach, such as the potential for slower decision-making processes.

DAO groups help to mitigate these limitations. By including smaller, specialized groups within the larger framework of the Y-Foundry DAO, more efficient decision-making and participation can be empowered and enabled by the larger community.

## DAO Groups - Best of Both Worlds
These additional groups within the Y-Foundry DAO play important roles in the operation and success of the platform.

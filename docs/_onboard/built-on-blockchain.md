Built on the Blockchain
=======================

The Internet is going through a transformation, a true revolution enabled by a single piece of technology --- blockchain. Through transparent interactions and verifiable data, blockchain technology enables a system of trustless coordination without a central authority.

### Coordination powered by Web3

Y-Foundry leverages blockchain technology to solve critical issues with online coordination.

**Accountability** - Smart contracts automate decisions and enable resources to be held until key milestones are met. This holds creators accountable to their community of supporters. If a project does not deliver to the satisfaction of its supporters a vote can initiate the return of remaining funds. 

**Decentralization** - The Y-Foundry platform is itself governed by the Y-Foundry DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which is owned by the participants of the ecosystem. Every participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and determine the direction of the platform.

**Security** - Builders on the Y-Foundry platform are whitelisted by the community and verified on-chain, providing an extra layer of transparency and prevention against fraud. Funding arrangements between Supporters and Builders are managed through secure escrow smart contracts without needing a human intermediary.

Y-Foundry connects the concepts of decentralized decision-making, on-chain automation, and DAO ownership to provide creators, builders, and the community with all the tools necessary to ensure a project's success.

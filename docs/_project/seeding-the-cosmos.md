Seeding the Cosmos
=======================

Y-Foundry DAO is a community born out of frustration with the often extractive and insecure nature of crypto. Manipulation infects systems advertised as trustless, leading to unintended consequences and losses. Cults of personalities develop and take advantage of the uninformed.

The Y-Foundry platform aims to provide solutions to the problems of coordination. Its open-source software provides a critical framework for connecting with the community and promoting the advancement of ideas in an auditable, transparent and trustless manner.

Potential use cases enabled by the Y-Foundry platform include, but aren't necessarily limited to:
- On-chain, transparent funding process
    - Escrow capabilities for funds to be secured until ready for release
    - Timed funding disbursements through on-chain milestones
    - Automatic funding clawback option initiated via Booster or community vote if milestones are not met
- Community vetting of builders through whitelisting process 
- Job platform with on-chain guaranteed payment for completed work
- Flexible options for claiming disbursements through the use of innovative NFTs
- Unique governance mechanisms freely available for projects using the platform


And more!

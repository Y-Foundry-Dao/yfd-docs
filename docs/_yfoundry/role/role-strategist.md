# About The Proposer

***

![Strategist](/assets/images/learn/role/strategist.png)

***

## Requirement
The Proposer role is granted to community members who initiate a Proposal. 

### Submitting the Proposal
- The Proposer works with the Y-Foundry DAO community to refine a project vault idea.
- They identify builders to work on the project.
- They create a detailed proposal to submit to the Y-Foundry platform.

***

## Responsibilities
### Funding the Vault
The Proposer must partially fund the vault proposal. This amount a Proposer must fund is 5% of the overall cost of the vault development. This will be used for the initial payment to the builders.

{: .note}
> This not only gives the Proposer more skin in the game but also serves as a protection for Boosters wishing to fund the project. See [Development Process](../../vault/3-development/) for more details on this.

A Proposer has the option to fund more than 5%. They could choose to fully fund the proposal or leave some portion of the funding available to potential Boosters.

### Managing Progress
Although the community will help to validate progress and test development, a Proposer is ultimately responsible for realizing the vision of the vault. A Proposer will lead the project community, navigating roadblocks to reach the launch.

***

## Benefits
The Proposer unlocks the ability to use the Y-Foundry platform to bring their ideas to life. They will get Booster NFTs representing a share of the success of the proposed vault. See [NFT Generation](../../vault/5-vault-nft/) and [Profit Sharing Disbursement](../../vault/6-profit-sharing/) for more details.

Built on the Blockchain
=======================

The Internet is going through a transformation, a true revolution enabled by a single piece of technology --- blockchain. Through transparent interactions and verifiable data, blockchain technology creates a system of trustless coordination eliminating the need for a central authority.

### Coordination powered by Web3

Y-Foundry leverages blockchain technology to solve critical issues with online coordination.

**Accountability** - Smart contracts automate decisions and enable resources to be held until key milestones are met. For example, if a project does not deliver to the satisfaction of its supporters a vote can initiate the return of remaining funds. This holds creators accountable to their community of supporters. If they do not deliver on their promises they miss out on a large chunk of their funding.

**Decentralization** - Supporters are Boosters of projects on Y-Foundry. Boosters have a say in the direction of their projects through a novel implementation of NFTs. The Y-Foundry platform is itself governed by the Y-Foundry DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) owned by the participants of the ecosystem. Every participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and determine the direction of the platform.

**Security** - Project leads and builders using the platform are whitelisted by the community and verified on-chain providing an extra layer of transparency and prevention against fraud. Initiative funding provided by Boosters is securely held in escrow until needed with no co-mingling of funds or human interaction required. Only previously agreed-upon builders coded into the initiative's smart contracts are eligible for payments. Builders can trust that the funding is guaranteed as long as they deliver the work as agreed upon.

Y-Foundry connects the concepts of decentralized decision-making, on-chain automation, and DAO ownership to provide creators, builders, and the community with all the tools necessary to ensure a project's success.

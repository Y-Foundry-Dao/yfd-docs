# Overview of $YFD

***

$YFD is the governance token of the Y-Foundry DAO. It has some unique characteristics that require a token holder to lock the token to obtain governance power and participate in certain activities on the platform. 

Each $YFD locker receives an amount of fYFD voting points giving the locker the right to vote on proposed changes to Y-Foundry DAO, submit a proposal, or fund an initiative on the Y-Foundry platform.

Y-Foundry DAO is truly decentralized. The Y-Foundry DAO community of Builders, Supporters, Proposers, and Voters lock the token to control the direction of the ecosystem through the governance process.

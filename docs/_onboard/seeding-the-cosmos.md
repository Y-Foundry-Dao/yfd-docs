Seeding the Cosmos
=======================

Y-Foundry DAO is a community born out of frustration and contempt with opaque and exploitative crypto projects. These projects are often run by personalities who abuse their cult-like following to extract value from uninformed participants, while avoiding transparency and accountability for their actions and decisions.

The Y-Foundry platform aims to solve this problem by providing an open-source funding and governance capability that enables and promotes building in an accountable, auditable, transparent and trustless manner.

Potential use cases enabled by the Y-Foundry platform include, but aren't necessarily limited to:
- On-chain, transparent funding process
    - Escrow capabilities for funds to be secured until ready for release
    - Timed funding disbursements through on-chain milestones
    - Automatic funding clawback option initiated via Supporter or community vote if milestones are not met
- Community vetting of builders through whitelisting process 
- Job platform with on-chain guaranteed payment for completed work
- Flexible options for claiming disbursements through the use of innovative NFTs
- Unique governance mechanisms freely available for projects using the platform


And more!


Built on Cosmos technology, Y-Foundry forges the much-needed trustless tools and secure processes to allow decentralized communities to truly florish.

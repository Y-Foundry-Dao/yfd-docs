Overview
=======================

***

This section provides a basic overview of how the Y-Foundry platform works. For a more in-depth look at the technical details and features of the platform, visit the "?" section. To learn how to use Y-Foundry, visit the "?" section.

## Y-Foundry Platform

The Y-Foundry platform is a decentralized marketplace for ideas, powered by the Y-Foundry DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). It enables Proposers, Builders, and Supporters to collaborate and bring new projects to life in a transparent, accountable, and secure way.

## Y-Foundry DAO
The Y-Foundry DAO (YFD) is the decentralized, community-driven organization that operates the Y-Foundry platform. It consists of a variety of roles, including Voters, Builders, Proposers, and Supporters, all of whom work together to bring new ideas to life on the platform.

<br>

### The Forge

The Forge is the governance contract of the Y-Foundry DAO. Individuals can deposit their YFD tokens in the Forge to acquire governance power through fYFD [link here], which allows them to perform different actions on the platform, participate in the voting process, and shape the overall direction of Y-Foundry.

### Roles

The Y-Foundry DAO supports a variety of roles for users to participate in the ecosystem. 

|:-------|:--------|
| ![Voter Bot](../../assets/images/role/voter/voter-bot-128.png) | Voter: A governing member of the community who has the power to vote on proposals and shape the direction of the platform. |
| ![Proposer Bot](../../assets/images/role/proposer/proposer-bot-128.png) | Proposer: Someone who wants to get funding and help to launch a project on the Y-Foundry platform. |
| ![Supporter Bot](../../assets/images/role/supporter/supporter-bot-128.png) | Supporter: Someone who provides funding in exchange for either profit sharing or governance power over a project, or both. |
| ![Builder Bot](../../assets/images/role/builder/builder-bot-128.png) | Builder: Someone who commits work to the platform, such as completing bounties or working on funded projects. |

{: .note }
> In addition, there are also the users of the Y-Foundry marketplace. Users are individuals who use the products and services developed on the platform, but are not necessarily members of the DAO and do not have the same rights and responsibilities as other roles.

<br>

### Crucibles

Crucibles are the working groups of the Y-Foundry DAO. They consist of small teams of specialists each with a particular focus and dedicated to the long-term health of the platform. They are the foundational pillars of the YFD protocol. The crucibles approach the DAO with initiatives to improve the Y-Foundry platform. If the community agrees then they will get the necessary funding to accomplish the task. See governance proposals for more details. (link here)

Not only do they provide thought leadership for their respective areas of focus, they can also help determine the direction of the protocol through influencing new vault/project proposals and critical governance items.

<br>

### Caretaker Council

The Caretaker Council is a temporary group of experienced and respected members of the YFD community, with expertise in the Cosmos ecosystem, crypto governance, or other related fields. Their role is to provide guidance and direction to the protocol during its early stages, advising the DAO on key issues and helping to prevent governance attacks. 

As more members of the DAO become involved in governance, the Council's influence will naturally diminish over time due to the nature of the fYFD voting power (link here). The Council's main purpose is to help ensure a smooth launch and successful scaling of YFD. Once this has been achieved, the Council will no longer be needed.

<br>

### Treasury Multisig

The Treasury Multisig (link here) is a group of key individuals within the Cosmos ecosystem who have been entrusted with the responsibility of securing a portion of the treasury until the DAO determines it is ready to be self-managed by the Forge (link here). 

When it has been determined that the Forge is ready to manage the treasury independently, the Y-Foundry DAO will create a governance proposal (link here) to transfer all funds from the Treasury Multisig to the Forge. This proposal will be carried out in accordance with the governance processes of the DAO, ensuring that the decision is made democratically and transparently. Once the proposal has been enacted and the funds have been transferred, the Forge will be fully responsible for the management of the treasury.

***

## Proposals
The proposal process is a key part of the Y-Foundry platform, and all roles have a contribution to make. Proposers can submit ideas for vaults or initiatives to the Foundry, and Supporters can provide funding to help bring these ideas to life. Builders can work on funded projects and contribute to the development of the platform. Finally, Voters can use their governance power to vote on proposals and help determine the direction of the projects.

### Proposal Types

|:-------|:--------|
| Initiative | Proposers and Supporters can pool funds to develop and launch a variety of projects, with built-in governance and management mechanisms to ensure successful development. |
| Vault | Proposers and Supporters can create and launch automated DeFi investment strategies through pooling funds and using the built-in governance mechanisms of the vault. This allows for the management of development and distribution of profits to all Supporters. |
| Governance | Y-Foundry DAO can perform various governance actions, such as Builder whitelisting, treasury spending, emergency proposals, and token whitelisting. These proposals allow Voters to make important decisions that shape the direction and operation of the platform. |

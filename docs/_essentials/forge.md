The Forge
=========

***

The Forge is the governance contract of Y-Foundry DAO. Users can deposit $YFD tokens into the Forge to acquire fYFD points.

### How fYFD points work

1. A user has $YFD tokens.

1. The user deposits tokens in the Forge with a target block number (as the date/time). That block marks the time the final portion of $YFD gets reclaimed. See [How Y-Foundry DAO Governance Works](../../govern/participate/) for more details. The user get issued fYFD points.

1. fYFD points can be used to:

    -   Submit governance proposals.

    -   Fund any proposal. Each fYFD point allows you to fund additional amounts to a proposal (eg. 1 point = $0.01 of funding capacity).

1. Points decay each block.

1. The user can reclaim the decayed fYFD as $YFD.

{: .note }
> Submitting a proposal locks fYFD points. These points stop decaying until the proposal process has been completed. This allows community to penalize bad actors (points can be seized).

***

Users with enough fYFD points can create [Proposals](../../govern/proposal/).

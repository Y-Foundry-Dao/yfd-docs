# About Y-Foundry



## The Protocol

#### WHAT IS THE UNIQUE VALUE OF Y-FOUNDRY DAO?

_The ability for the protocol to self-fund development without dilution of its token/governance power._

_The decoupling of Governance and the Treasury, such that the Treasury is a smart contract accountable to perform actions as determined by on-chain governance._

_This is in contrast to the current models of governance in DeFi where governance proposals are generally “text-only”, and the executor of the governance action is usually a human or group of human beings using a multisig or shared private key._

_The ability to provide guaranteed funding to developers through the escrow of funds to a smart contract with the capability for clawbacks should the stakeholders determine that deliverables have not been met._

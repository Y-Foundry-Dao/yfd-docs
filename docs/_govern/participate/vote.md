### ✋🏽 Quorum

{: .highlight-title }
> Reaching Quorum
>
> Because $YFD unlocks due to fYFD points decaying each block, inactive users slowly lose goverance power. This means that active users that reclaim and relock $YFD stand to gain an increased proportion of governance power over time. This will reduce the threshold for reaching quorum.

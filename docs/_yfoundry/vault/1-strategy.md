# ðŸ’¡ Vault Ideation & Proposal Creation

***

A [Proposer](../../yfoundry/role/role-strategist/) with a vault idea connects to the Y-Foundry DAO community to receive guidance on developing the proposal. A proposal should typically include information on the why, what, how, who, and when of the vault idea and a detailed plan to launch.

<br>

{: .note}
> The Y-Foundry platform is flexible enough to accommodate a broad range of initiatives. Although each idea may be unique, the process to get started is the same. 

<br>

The Proposer is then connected with potential [Supporters](../../yfoundry/role/role-supporter/) of the vault and whitelisted [Builders](../../_yfoundry/role/role-developer.md) who are ready to help with the project.

<br>

{: .important }
> This part of the process is _Off-chain for MVP_
>
> Y-Foundry DAO utilizes a variety of tools including Dework, Github, and Discord to organize discussions and provide support for proposals.

<br>

Once the idea has been refined and all the details have been identified, the proposal is ready to be submitted officially on the Y-Foundry platform.

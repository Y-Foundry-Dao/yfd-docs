Y-Foundry
=========

Introducing Y-Foundry!

Y-Foundry is a platform connecting community with creators to propose, vote, and build their ideas.

**Developed by the community.**

**Owned by the community.**

Bringing an idea to market requires massive amounts of effort to coordinate developers, creators, and investment capital. Y-Foundry provides creators with the means to connect with the community and launch their projects. Anyone with a great idea can propose it to the Y-Foundry DAO, receive support to expand on their ideas, and find additional resources within the community. Y-Foundry enables creators and developers to connect, ideate, fund, and build the community-owned crypto projects of tomorrow.

### Coordination powered by Web3

Y-Foundry leverages blockchain technology to solve critical issues with online coordination.

**Accountability** - Smart contracts automate decisions and enable resources to be held until key milestones are met. For example, if a project does not deliver to the satisfaction of its supporters a vote can initiate the return of remaining funds. This holds creators accountable to their community of supporters. If they do not deliver on their promises they miss out on a large chunk of their funding.

**Decentralization** - Supporters are Boosters of projects on Y-Foundry. Boosters have a say in the direction of their projects through a novel implementation of NFTs. The Y-Foundry platform is itself governed by the Y-Foundry Decentralized Autonomous Organization owned by the participants of the ecosystem. Every participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and determine the direction of the platform.

**Security** - Project leads and builders using the platform are whitelisted by the community and verified on-chain providing an extra layer of transparency and prevention against fraud. Initiative funding provided by Boosters is securely held in escrow until needed with no co-mingling of funds or human interaction required. Only previously agreed-upon builders coded into the initiative's smart contracts are eligible for payments. Builders can trust that the funding is guaranteed as long as they deliver the work as agreed upon.

Y-Foundry connects the concepts of decentralized decision-making, on-chain automation, and DAO ownership to provide creators, builders, and the community with all the tools necessary to ensure a project's success.

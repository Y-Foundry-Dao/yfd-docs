# 🏦 Vaults

***

Y-Foundry vaults are specialized smart contracts that allow creators to propose, fund, and build community-owned crypto projects. They are reliable enough for managing trustless funding, powerful enough to automate the management of resources, and flexible enough to support a wide variety of initiatives.

***

### 💡 Vault Ideation & Proposal Creation

A proposer with a promising project idea seeks out the Y-Foundry DAO community to build a solid proposal and find talent to help execute it.

***

### ✍️ Proposal Process

A proposer submits the details of the proposal officially through the Y-Foundry platform to get community support and funding.

*** 

### 💻 Development Process

Once a project has been fully funded, development begins. Builders complete development milestones to unlock additional payments to build the project idea.
			
***

### 📡 Deployment Process

When development has been finalized, the contract is uploaded to the blockchain and instantiated by the DAO to be hosted on Y-Foundry.

### 🖼️ NFT Generation for Proposer, Boosters, & YFD Treasury

Novel NFTs are minted representing the contributions of those that fund the project. Each NFT gives the holder the right to claim any benefits allocated to supporters of the vault and provides potential governance rights.

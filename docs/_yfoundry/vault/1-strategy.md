# ðŸ’¡ Vault Development

***

A proposer with a vault idea connects to the Y-Foundry DAO community to receive guidance on developing the proposal. A proposal is a detailed plan for the vault. It clearly includes the what, how, who, and when information needed to launch the project successfully.

<br>

{: .note}
> The Y-Foundry platform is flexible enough to accommodate a broad range of initiatives. Although each idea may be unique, the process to get started is the same. 

<br>

The proposer gets connected with potential supporters of the vault including whitelisted developers ready to build the project.

<br>

{: .important }
> This part of the process is _Off-chain for MVP_
>
> Y-Foundry DAO utilizes a variety of tools including Dework, Github, and Discord to organize discussions and provide support for proposals.

<br>

Once the idea has been refined and all the details have been identified, the proposal is ready to be submitted officially on the Y-Foundry platform.

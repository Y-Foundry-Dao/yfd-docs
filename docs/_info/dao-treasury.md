DAO Treasury
============

### Forge Contract = DAO Treasury

The Forge is seeded with $YFD which can be accessed using an on-chain governance *Spend* proposal.

{: .note }
For MVP the Forge is back-stopped with an on-chain 5 of 9 signer multi-signature wallet holding the majority of the $YFD tokens. The majority of the DAO's tokens are held in this multi-signature wallet post-TGE. This is a smart contract that requires the agreement of five of the nine (signers) to perform an action. The Treasury Multi-sig serves as a useful stopgap to ensure the healthy operation of the platform through MVP launch prior to moving all funds to the DAO treasury.

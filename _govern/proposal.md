## fYFD Locking During Proposal Duration 
When a proposal is submitted the portion of the proposer‚Äôs fYFD equivalent to the amount required to submit a proposal is ‚Äúlocked‚Äù for the duration of the submission process. The ‚ÄúfYFD‚Äù used to submit the proposal maintains a ‚Äúlocked‚Äù status until the associated proposal status changes at the completion voting period and is defined as either accepted or rejected.  

Locked fYFD means the fYFD and $YFD equivalent are unavailable for:
* Withdrawal to $YFD
* Meeting the fYFD submission requirements of additional proposals.

When the voting period is complete the fYFD locked for the proposal:
* On a No with Veto an amount of $YFD equivalent to the fYFD locked for the proposal  is sent to the { TREASURY ADDRESS }
* On an Affirmative or standard No vote outcome is unlocked and available to the proposer to withdraw or use again on another proposal

Submission would not exceed the Active Proposal Maximum for an individual.

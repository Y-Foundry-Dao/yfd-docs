# Welcome to Y-Foundry DAO

Y-Foundry Document Library 

## Welcome

Propose. Vote. Build.

Y-Foundry DAO is a community-run funding platform enabling those with ideas to connect, ideate, fund, develop, and launch the community-owned crypto projects of tomorrow.

With YFD, you can:
1. Launch vaults that automate strategies that use assets in Defi, such as auto-compounding, arbitrage, or hedging.
2. Become a backer of other users' vault ideas, claiming a portion of the fees earned.
3. Take on interesting tasks, earn reputation, and build a portfolio of experience in Web3.
4. Work for projects paid for by the community, with payments guaranteed by smart contracts.

Y-Foundry DAO leverages smart contracts and NFTs in novel ways to enable:
1. Democratized access to talented builders that have been whitelisted by the community.
2. Secure mechanisms for automated project funding once delivery milestones are met.
3. Auditable, trustless execution of projects without human intervention.
4. A community with a vested long-term interest in protecting the marketplace.

## This is a living set of documents. Â 

The purpose is to inform those curious about Y-Foundry DAO on how the protocol works and its various capabilities and mechanisms for interaction.

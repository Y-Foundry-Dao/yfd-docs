Roles
=====


***

Y-Foundry DAO is the governing community supporting the Y-Foundry ecosystem. Potential participants of the platform have the opportunity to obtain specialized roles. 

Roles play an important part in the successful operation of Y-Foundry. Each role has specific requirements to obtain, responsibilities to manage, and benefits to unlock for the participant.

Roles are not mutually exclusive. A single individual can have multiple roles as long as the requirements are met for each.

### The Booster

Booster role represents members who help fund a proposal. This role implies putting up collateral along with the vote.

The funding floor for a Booster is 5% of the asking amount, while offering the possibility of going up to 100%.

Please note funding has a max limit. If that limit is reached, the Booster role cannot be acquired.

### The Developer

Developer role is given to the members performing the development portion of the task(s) in the proposal.

This role does not require any collateral or even a vote from the user. It does require that the user is whitelisted by the community to work on YFD projects.

The Developer can hold other roles as well, even the Strategist

- Absolute majority â€” When a vote outcome receives more than 50% of the votes cast.

- Booster/Boosting â€” A person who contributes to the development costs of a vault is a Booster. The act of doing so is called Boosting. An NFT is issued to Boosters as a record of their Boosting activity.  

- Boule â€” The governing body of YFD. This is made up of fYFD holders.

- First/Second generation vaults â€” First generation vaults can only auto-compound rewards, while second generation vaults require a human operator to act on market contingencies.

- Forge â€” The smart contract that gives users governance powers by committing their $YFD to a Forging Period. $YFD held in the Forge contract are represented as fYFD and grant a user the ability to vote on proposals, become a Booster, and more.

- Forging Period â€” The number of blocks a userâ€™s $YFD is held by the Forge contract as fYFD before reclaimable as $YFD. The governance power of a userâ€™s fYFD is proportionate length of the selected Forging Period multiplied by block equivalent of time it is forged for (between 2 - 104 weeks).

- fYFD â€” The governance value of a userâ€™s locked $YFD tokens. fYFD represents $YFD tokens that are deposited into the Forge. Once deposited, fYFD has a Forging Period, during which it gradually unlocks. For example, a user who locks in their $YFD for 1 year will have unlocked roughly 33% of their tokens in 120 days, or 50% in 180 days, or 100% after 365 days.

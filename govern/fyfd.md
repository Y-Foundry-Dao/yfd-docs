# üîê$YFD deposit (fYFD Points)


Users who lock $YFD in the Forge Contract become a member of the Boule.

Depositing $YFD tokens issues fYFD points that decay over a locking period.

### Quorum
fYFD points degrade over time making active participants proportion of governance increase over time as inactive lockers.  Which makes achieving quorum easier over time.

### Cumulative Vesting

Vesting means unlocking of $YFD Tokens. Each category unlocks the tokens as such:

-   The Genesis Reserve will be available immediately (4% of token supply)

-   Investors (9.08% of token supply) will unlock partial tokens every month, and at the end of 18 months all of their tokens will be unlocked.

-   Genesis Contributors will unlock tokens monthly, but for the first 3 months 0 tokens will be unlocked. On the 4th month unlock gets a boost (compensating for the prior 3 months), then equal amounts will unlock each month. Full unlock is reached after 30 months.

# $YFD Utility

### notes from the genesis contributor - Crash

```Honestly early on if someone uses keybase to propose and gets community support then they should get awarded YFD to match their collateral
Since YFD protocol will ultimately get shares to benefit
And then eventually replace the reputation and consensus need and drive the shares that YFD gets down too

20% - 15% - 10% etc

```


### Notes from the genesis contributor - Ray

``` I think a reason on why $YFD is required to get funding and do proposals is because YFD wants participation in governance / management of the platform to be distributed
and one way to ensure that distribution is require that people at least have skin in the game to use the platform
and staking $YFD gives people an essentially mandated civil service role
an idea going forward (long-term) would be to make this mandated civil service contribution based but because of the narrowed vision of what is considered participation rather than being assessed through complex mechanisms of measurement regarding participation which can be built out in the future -- the current MVP representation of participation is done via the $YFD token
token-gating the platform for launch
but the idea that token-gating is something that the platform should strive to evolve beyond or build up other mechanisms to gate participation along-side tokens
because -- more utility alpha here -- how else can we represent participation or engagement in the platform across blockchains except with tokens at this point?

if we want to have the Chain A deployment/governance recognize someone who's been contributing / engaged on Chain X deployment of YFD - the  most effective way to measure that right now is $YFD{token} -- that can be maintained on-chain and not using some external database
as IBC / Cross-chain contract calls evolve Chain A YFD contracts could potentially query the Chain X Forge to ask it to vouch for interchain {wallet} account addresses
but we're not there yet, but I could see us going that way

so people can build reputation across the YFD ecosystem... and when as we talked in the past but haven't really brought up lately -- the YFD deployments consider forming their own appchain with a consortium governance - those reputation records for the entire ecosystem could be stored in contracts there

I think we are doing this the 'smart way' -- toward pure utility -- where we deploy the chains of YFD and eventually they build their own hub rather than build the hub and deploy from it```

Retirement
==========

This is the last stage in the life of a Vault.

To retire or decommission a vault, the use of an emergency proposal called Vault Stop is necessary. Vault Stop disallows the vault contract from accepting new funds.

Secondary function of Vault Stop may include withdrawing all assets from the underlying strategy protocols to the safety of the vault contract itself.

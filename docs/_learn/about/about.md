# About Y-Foundry


## The Protocol

### YFD is about getting ideas off the ground.

YFD provides support to people as they take steps toward realizing their goals.

Imagine a crowdfunding platform and marketplace owned by a community of builders and utilizing cutting-edge blockchain technology to enable secure operations, transparent governance, and automated payment for work performed. Y-Foundry DAO is this community-driven accelerator of ideas providing a powerful way for creators to connect with builders and funding in a transparent and decentralized way.


### Decentralized, but not in name only.

Y-Foundry is a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Built on blockchain technology and smart contracts, YFD provides an open-source platform for members to vote on decisions related to the projects, platform, and marketplace that make up the YFD ecosystem. Y-Foundry DAO has been created to empower creators, developers and builders with the tools and resources needed to bring their ideas to life. YFD gives entrepreneurs a platform to launch the community-owned crypto projects of the future.


### Draw on your community for support and guidance.

Creators are able to receive input from the community and refine their ideas before proposing a project. When a project idea is ready, Creators can submit it to the community for consideration.


### What is the unique value of Y-Foundry DAO?

_The ability for the protocol to self-fund development without dilution of its token/governance power._

_The decoupling of Governance and the Treasury, such that the Treasury is a smart contract accountable to perform actions as determined by on-chain governance._

_This is in contrast to the current models of governance in DeFi where governance proposals are generally “text-only”, and the executor of the governance action is usually a human or group of human beings using a multisig or shared private key._

_The ability to provide guaranteed funding to developers through the escrow of funds to a smart contract with the capability for clawbacks should the stakeholders determine that deliverables have not been met._

# ðŸ’» Development Process 
_(post-approval)_

***

Once a project vault has been fully funded and all development milestones have been locked in, development on the project begins.

***

### Development begins
Once the proposal is approved, the initial payment (if any) is immediately claimable by the whitelisted builders identified in the proposal.

{: .important }
> The initial payment is limited to the amount contributed by the proposer only. Booster funds are not used for this initial payment. 
>
> If a proposer and developer collude to try to take advantage of the Boosters, they would only be rugging themselves.


***

### Milestones
Specific milestones are detailed in each on-chain proposal. The project vault proposer and Boosters, with support from the Y-Foundry DAO, are responsible to ensure that development is progressing as expected according to these milestones.

Once the milestone date has been passed, Boosters can choose to hold a vote based on development progress.

VOTE | RESULTS
YES | Funds are released directly to builders for continued development.
NO | No funds are released at this time. Another vote may be called when sufficient progress has been demonstrated.

{At the completion of each milestone, Boosters can vote to release additional funds from the overall escrow. Builders will then be able to claim these funds for continued development.}

{: .note }
> If a situation arises where there is a need to cancel the proposal entirely, a vote can be called by the Y-Foundry DAO. If the DAO votes to cancel the proposal, the Boosters will receive a return of the remaining funds proportional to the amount they originally deposited in the vault minus any disbursements for development that has already taken place.

***

### Development conclusion
Once the development has been completed, the developers submit the finalized code for review. The Y-Foundry DAO community and relevant third parties audit the code to ensure it is secure and working as intended.

***

### Work is completed
The vault proposer and Boosters call a vote to sign off that the work has been completed. The final payment is now claimable by the project builders. The project proceeds to deploy on Y-Foundry.

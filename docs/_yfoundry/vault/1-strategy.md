# ðŸ’¡Strategy Development

A proposer with a vault idea gets connected to the Y-Foundry DAO community to receive guidance on developing the proposal. 

The Y-Foundry platform is flexible enough to accommodate a broad range of initiatives. Although each idea may be unique, the process to get started is the same. 

The proposer
- Develops the prospectus with the assistance of the Y-Foundry DAO community
- Gets connected with whitelisted developers ready to build the project


{: .important }
> This part of the process is _Off-chain for MVP_
>
> Y-Foundry DAO utilizes a variety of tools including Dework, Github, and Discord to organize discussions and provide support for proposals.

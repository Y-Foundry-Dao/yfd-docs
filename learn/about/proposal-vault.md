🏦Vault proposals

Individual vault proposals can accept funds in stablecoins from users with fYFD points.
Once fully funded, a vault proposal issues Booster NFTs to users who contributed funds, as well as the proposer.
Funds can only be disbursed to the pre-whitelisted developer specified in the proposal.
Vault proposals will escrow development funds to the developer, to be claimed on a block-based milestone basis.

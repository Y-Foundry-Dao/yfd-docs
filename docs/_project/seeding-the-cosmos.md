Seeding the Cosmos
=======================

Y-Foundry DAO is a community born out of frustration with the often extractive and insecure nature of crypto. Manipulation infects systems advertised as trustless, leading to unintended consequences and losses. Cults of personalities develop and take advantage of the uninformed.

The Y-Foundry platform aims to provide solutions to the problems of online coordination. Its open-source software provides a critical framework for connecting with the community and promoting the advancement of ideas.

Included:
- On-chain, transparent funding process
    - Escrow capabilities for funds to be secured until needed
    - Timed funding disbursements through on-chain milestones
    - Automatic funding clawback option initiated via community vote if milestones are not met
- Community vetting of participants through whitelisting process 
- Job platform with on-chain guaranteed payment for completed work
- Flexible options for claiming disbursements through the use of innovative NFTs
- Unique governance mechanisms freely available for projects using the platform


And more!

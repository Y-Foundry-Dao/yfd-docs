# ðŸ’¸ Profit Sharing Disbursement

***

Depending on the underlying strategy, some vaults allow Boosters to claim a portion of the fees generated by the vault. This process is facilitated through the Booster NFTs. 

First, the vault disburses funds to a claim contract which recognizes the vault contract. The claim contract has a record of Booster NFTs associated with that specific vault. It determines the amount claimable for each Booster NFT based on the proportional value set at mint and the amount already claimed for that NFT.

The claim contract is like a clearing house for the Y-Foundry platform - validating and finalizing the disbursement process between the vault and Booster. In a trustless and automated way, this process ensures that all Booster NFT holders are able to easily collect the amount available to them.
